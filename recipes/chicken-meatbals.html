        <p>
          Chicken meatballs made from ground chicken, seasonings, and oats
          instead of breadcrumbs. These meatballs are the perfect addition to
          Snack City in your freezer. They can be eaten plain, sauced, or used
          to add in meals. They have been my favorite resident of Snack City
          lately.

        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="steps">
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Preheat your oven to 400°F.</li>
          <li>
            If you need grind your chicken, do so. I make ground chicken by
            placing boneless skinless chicken thighs into the food processor
            until it resembles ground meat. I do a bunch at once and freeze the
            excess.
          </li>
          <li>
            In a large bowl, add your ground chicken, rolled oats, eggs, onion
            powder, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Mix it together until
            everything is fully incorporated.
          </li>
          <li>
            Line a few large baking sheets with foil in preparation for the
            meatballs. It may help to spray lightly with oil.
          </li>
          <li>
            Using a cookie scoop, create meatballs and spread out on to your
            sheet pans. Space them out evenly with some room between each so
            that they will brown more easily.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once you have all of the meatballs created, form them into a tighter
            ball by tossing each meatball between your hands a few times. It
            will help to spray your hands with a bit of oil to keep the chicken
            from sticking.
          </li>
          <li>Roast your meatballs in the oven for 17-20 minutes.</li>
          <li>
            Doing one sheet pan at a time will lead to better browning. If you
            try to place a pan onto each rack, the one on the top rack will
            struggle to get brown due to the steam being released from the
            bottom pan. They will still taste awesome and I do two at once for
            speed but just be aware that you will sacrifice some browning. When
            the meatballs are finished, remove from the oven and allow to cool.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once all of your meatballs have been cooled, transfer them to one
            single sheet pan and move to your freezer to flash freeze. This just
            means that you freeze them, uncovered in a single layer, so that
            they have a chance to freeze individually.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once they have frozen solid, transfer them over into a ziplock bag,
            remove all of the air and move them into Snack City in your freezer.
          </li>

            I made 83 meatballs out of this recipe. The nutrition information
            you see here is for 83 meatballs. If you end up having more or less
            than that, your nutrition information will be slightly different.
